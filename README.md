## Description:
A Chuck Norris jokes app, with categories of jokes and side-menu using modern frameworks.

In this application, I studied new methods of organizing layouts, such as applying a side menu and synchronizing it with the top toolbar, using fragments and a single activity for the application.

Also the introduction the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) design pattern and applying it to this project. In addition to different libraries to optimize application development.


Used libraries:
* **groupie** : *Groupie is a simple, flexible library for complex RecyclerView layouts.*

* **retrofit** : *A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.*

* **splash screen** : *Starting in Android 12, the SplashScreen API lets apps launch with animation, including an into-app motion at launch, a splash screen showing your app icon, and a transition to your app itself.*

* **picasso** : *A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android*
